      "METHODS: We performed RNA-sequencing in a papillary thyroid cancer lacking other frequent driver alterations.\n",
      "RESULTS: We report a novel RTK fusion, TG-IGF1R, in a 17-year-old female patient with angioinvasive follicular variant papillary thyroid cancer. The in-frame fusion protein preserves the cholinesterase-like domain of TG with dimerization properties and the transmembrane and kinase domain of IGF1R. The tumor sample shows increased IGF1R mRNA expression and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, augmentation of MAPK transcriptional output genes and decreased NIS levels.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: We reveal a novel targetable kinase fusion oncogene in thyroid cancer which is not incorporated in different thyroid-specific sequencing panels. The integration of IGF1R fusion screening in the next versions of thyroid-specific targeted NGS panels may be beneficial to thyroid cancer patients.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Tyrosine kinase (TK) fusions are frequently found in cancers, either as initiating events or as a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy. Partner genes and exons in most TK fusions are followed typical recurrent patterns, but the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these patterns are poorly understood. By developing Functionally Active Chromosomal Translocation Sequencing (FACTS), we discover that typical TK fusions involving ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 are selected from pools of chromosomal rearrangements by two major determinants: active transcription of the fusion partner genes and protein stability. In contrast, atypical TK fusions that are rarely seen in patients showed reduced protein stability, decreased downstream oncogenic signaling, and were less responsive to inhibition. Consistently, patients with atypical TK fusions were associated with a reduced response to TKI therapies. Our findings highlight the principles of oncogenic TK fusion formation and selection in cancers, with clinical implications for guiding targeted therapy.\n",

      "Macrophage-stimulating protein receptor, also known as MST1R or RON kinase, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MST1R gene. It is related to the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MST1R protein is involved in signal transduction and cell communication through its interaction with adaptor proteins such as GRB2. The GRB2 protein contains one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, which direct complex formation with proline-rich regions of other proteins and bind tyrosine phosphorylated sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MST1R protein is a type of receptor tyrosine kinase, which can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to the tyrosine residues of specific proteins inside a cell. This process is an important mechanism for communicating signals within a cell and regulating cellular activity, such as cell division.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND: In v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC), encorafenib-cetuximab has been established as standard second-line therapy, but not all patients respond and the duration of response is relatively short. Overcoming intrinsic or acquired resistance to BRAF/EGFR inhibitors is crucial for enhancing treatment outcomes in metastatic BRAF-mutated CRC. The aim of the study is to investigate the resistance mechanisms in BRAF-mutant CRC patient refractory to BRAF/EGFR targeted therapy.\n",
      "METHODS: We established patient-derived cells (PDCs) from a patient with BRAF/PTEN-mutant metastatic colon cancer who progressed rapidly on encorafenib plus cetuximab. To explore potential treatment options for inherent resistance caused by simultaneous PTEN mutation in BRAF-mutated CRC, we conducted cell viability assays using PDCs treated with encorafenib-cetuximab in combination with a cyclin-dependent kinase-4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor.\n",
      "RESULTS: The patient's tumor had concurrent PTEN loss-of-function alteration at diagnosis and PDCs were generated from ascites after resistance to the BRAF/EGFR inhibitor. The PDCs were resistant to the encorafenib-cetuximab combination even at a high concentration of cetuximab (up to 500 µg/mL). Adding the CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, to encorafenib-cetuximab showed a synergistic effect in a proliferation assay. Ribociclib plus encorafenib-cetuximab represented a significantly lower expression of Ki-67 compared to the dual combination alone. An MTS assay showed that triplet therapy with ribociclib, encorafenib, and cetuximab suppressed cell viability more efficiently than the two-drug combinations.

It phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Several of these targets, including p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX are tumor suppressors.\n",
      "In 1995, the gene was discovered by Yosef Shiloh who named its product ATM since he found that its mutations are responsible for the disorder ataxia–telangiectasia.

      "Symptoms most often first appear in early childhood (the toddler stage) when children begin to sit or walk. Though they usually start walking at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still or sitting. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their eyes in a natural manner from one place to the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech, and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A–T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A–T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.\n",

Single-strand breaks are repaired by DNA ligase using the complementary strand of the double helix as a template, with DNA ligase creating the final phosphodiester bond to fully repair the DNA.\n",

      "Summary: ATM serine/threonine kinase or Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, symbol ATM, is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks (canonical pathway), oxidative stress, topoisomerase cleavage complexes, splicing intermediates, R-loops and in some cases by single-strand DNA breaks. It phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Several of these targets, including p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX are tumor suppressors.\n",
      "In 1995, the gene was discovered by Yosef Shiloh who named its product ATM since he found that its mutations are responsible for the disorder ataxia–telangiectasia. In 1998, the Shiloh and Kastan laboratories independently showed that ATM is a protein kinase whose activity is enhanced by DNA damage.\n",

      "Summary: A serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.-) is a kinase enzyme, in particular a protein kinase,  that phosphorylates the OH group of the amino-acid residues serine or threonine, which have similar side chains. At least 350 of the 500+ human protein kinases are serine/threonine kinases (STK).\n",
      "In enzymology, the term serine/threonine protein kinase describes a class of enzymes in the family of transferases, that transfer phosphates to the oxygen atom of a serine or threonine side chain in proteins. This process is called phosphorylation. Protein phosphorylation in particular plays a significant role in a wide range of cellular processes and is a very important post-translational modification.\n",

      "Response: Thymidine kinase (TK) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in DNA synthesis by catalyzing the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to thymidine, resulting in the formation of thymidine monophosphate (dTMP). dTMP is then converted into thymidine triphosphate (dTTP), one of the four nucleotides required for DNA replication and repair. Cytosolic TK is primarily involved in the salvage pathway, recycling thymidine from degraded DNA. TK has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is a target for antiviral and anticancer therapies due to its role in maintaining dTTP pools essential for proper DNA synthesis.\n",
