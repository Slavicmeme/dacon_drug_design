Other symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and slow growth. Most children develop signs and symptoms shortly after birth. However, others may be diagnosed later in infancy or early childhood. About half of all children with Hirschsprung's disease are diagnosed in the first year of life. Complications may include enterocolitis, megacolon, bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation.\n",
      "The disorder may occur by itself or in association with other genetic disorders such as Down syndrome or Waardenburg syndrome. About half of isolated cases are linked to a specific genetic mutation, and about 20% occur within families. Some of these occur in an autosomal dominant manner. The cause of the remaining cases is unclear. If otherwise normal parents have one child with the condition, the next child has a 4% risk of being affected. The condition is divided into two main types, short-segment and long-segment, depending on how much of the bowel is affected. Rarely, the small bowel may be affected, as well. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and confirmed by biopsy.\n",
      "Treatment is generally by surgery to remove the affected section of bowel. The surgical procedure most often carried out is known as a \"pull through\". Occasionally, an intestinal transplantation may be recommended. Hirschsprung's disease occurs in about one in 5,000 of newborns. Males are more often affected than females. The condition is believed to have first been described in 1691 by Dutch anatomist Frederik Ruysch and is named after Danish physician Harald Hirschsprung following his description in 1888.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Copyright Information: © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.\n",
      "Summary::\n",
      "AIMS: Microvascular dysfunction has been proposed to drive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but the initiating molecular and cellular events are largely unknown. Our objective was to determine when microvascular alterations in HFpEF begin, how they contribute to disease progression, and how pericyte dysfunction plays a role herein.\n",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS: Microvascular dysfunction, characterized by inflammatory activation, loss of junctional barrier function, and altered pericyte-endothelial crosstalk, was assessed with respect to the development of cardiac dysfunction, in the Zucker fatty and spontaneously hypertensive (ZSF1) obese rat model of HFpEF at three time points: 6, 14, and 21 weeks of age. Pericyte loss was the earliest and strongest microvascular change, occurring before prominent echocardiographic signs of diastolic dysfunction were present. Pericytes were shown to be less proliferative and had a disrupted morphology at 14 weeks in the obese ZSF1 animals, who also exhibited an increased capillary luminal diameter and disrupted endothelial junctions. Microvascular dysfunction was also studied in a mouse model of chronic reduction in capillary pericyte coverage (), which spontaneously developed many aspects of diastolic dysfunction. Pericytes exposed to oxidative stress  showed downregulation of cell cycle-associated pathways and induced a pro-inflammatory state in endothelial cells upon co-culture.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: We propose pericytes are important for maintaining endothelial cell function, where loss of pericytes enhances the reactivity of endothelial cells to inflammatory signals and promotes microvascular dysfunction, thereby accelerating the development of HFpEF.\n",

      "Cribriform morular thyroid carcinoma (CMTC) has been included within the group of thyroid tumors of uncertain histogenesis in the recent World Health Organization classification of endocrine tumors. Most CMTCs occur in young euthyroid women with multiple (and bilateral) thyroid nodules in cases associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or as single nodules in sporadic cases. CMTC generally behaves indolently, while aggressiveness and mortality are associated with high‑grade CMTC. This tumor histologically displays a distinctive combination of growth patterns with morular structures. Strong diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining for β‑catenin is the hallmark of CMTC. Tumor cells are also positive for thyroid transcription factor‑1 and for estrogen and progesterone receptors, but negative for thyroglobulin and calcitonin. It is possible that the CMTC phenotype could result from blockage in the terminal/follicular differentiation of follicular cells (or their precursor cells) secondary to the permanent activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway. In CMTC, the activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin pathway is the central pathogenetic event, which in FAP‑associated cases results from germline mutations of the APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway () gene, and in sporadic cases from somatic inactivating mutations in the  and  genes. Estrogens appear to play a tumor‑promoting role by stimulating both the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling pathways. Additional somatic mutations (i.e. RET rearrangements, or KRAS, phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit α, telomerase reverse transcriptase or tumor protein 53 mutations) may further potentiate the development and progression of CMTC.

Erdafitinib has previously demonstrated efficacy and safety in FGFR-altered advanced solid tumors, such as gliomas, thoracic, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and other rare cancers. However, its efficacy and safety in Asian patients remain largely unknown. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase IIa study of erdafitinib to evaluate its efficacy in Asian patients with FGFR-altered advanced cholangiocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and esophageal cancer.\n",
      "METHODS: Patients with pathologically/cytologically confirmed, advanced, or refractory tumors who met molecular and study eligibility criteria received oral erdafitinib 8 mg once daily with an option for pharmacodynamically guided up-titration to 9 mg on a 28-day cycle, except for four NSCLC patients who received erdafitinib 10 mg (7 days on/7 days off) as they were recruited before the protocol amendment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, duration of response, disease control rate, overall survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "BACKGROUND & AIMS: RET tyrosine kinase is necessary for enteric nervous system development. Loss-of-function RET mutations cause Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in which infants are born with aganglionic bowel. Despite surgical correction, patients with HSCR often experience chronic defecatory dysfunction and enterocolitis, suggesting that RET is important after development. To test this hypothesis, we determined the location of postnatal RET and its significance in gastrointestinal (GI) motility.\n",
      "METHODS: Ret mice and human transcriptional profiling data were studied to identify the enteric neuronal and epithelial cells that express RET. To determine whether RET regulates gut motility in vivo, genetic, and pharmacologic approaches were used to disrupt RET in all RET-expressing cells, a subset of enteric neurons, or intestinal epithelial cells.\n",
      "RESULTS: Distinct subsets of enteric neurons and enteroendocrine cells expressed RET in the adult intestine. RET disruption in the epithelium, rather than in enteric neurons, slowed GI motility selectively in male mice. RET kinase inhibition phenocopied this effect. Most RET epithelial cells were either enterochromaffin cells that release serotonin or L-cells that release peptide YY (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), both of which can alter motility. RET kinase inhibition exaggerated PYY and GLP-1 release in a nutrient-dependent manner without altering serotonin secretion in mice and human organoids. PYY receptor blockade rescued dysmotility in mice lacking epithelial RET.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: RET signaling normally limits nutrient-dependent peptide release from L-cells and this activity is necessary for normal intestinal motility in male mice. These effects could contr\u001b[0m\n",

Subgroup analyses showed that immunotherapies plus chemotherapy were superior to single-immunotherapy in terms of ORR, DCR, and median PFS, which were 43 % (95 % CI: 31%-55 %) vs. 17 % (95 % CI: 11%-25 %), 74 % (95 % CI: 60%-84 %) vs. 45 % (95 % CI: 31%-59 %) and 6.69 months (95 % CI: 4.91-8.93) vs. 2.96 months (95 % CI: 2.25-3.78), respectively.\n",

Subgroup analyses showed that immunotherapies plus chemotherapy were superior to single-immunotherapy in terms of ORR, DCR, and median PFS, which were 43 % (95 % CI: 31%-55 %) vs. 17 % (95 % CI: 11%-25 %), 74 % (95 % CI: 60%-84 %) vs. 45 % (95 % CI: 31%-59 %) and 6.69 months (95 % CI: 4.91-8.93) vs. 2.96 months (95 % CI: 2.25-3.78), respectively.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), a soluble protein mainly synthesized by the liver, is the only known ligand for recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), which is a member of the MET proto-oncogene family. Recent studies show that the MSP-RON signaling pathway not only was important in tumor behavior but also participates in the occurrence or development of many immune system diseases. Activation of RON in macrophages results in the inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response. MSP-RON is also associated with chronic inflammatory responses, especially chronic liver inflammation, and might serve as a novel regulator of inflammation, which may affect the metabolism in the body. Another study provided evidence of the relationship between MSP-RON and autoimmune diseases, suggesting a potential role for MSP-RON in the development of drugs for autoimmune diseases. Moreover, MSP-RON plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the tissue microenvironment and contributes to immune escape in the tumor immune microenvironment. Here, we summarize the role of MSP-RON in immunity, based on recent findings, and lay the foundation for further research.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "Advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC), featured by distinctive histopathological appearance, distant organ metastasis, acquired chemoresistance, and tumorigenic stemness is a group of heterogeneous cancers with unique genetic signatures and malignant phenotypes. Treatment of CRAC is a daunting task for oncologists. Currently, various strategies including molecular targeting using therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, small molecule kinase inhibitors and immunoregulatory checkpoint therapy have been applied to combat this deadly disease. However, these therapeutic modalities and approaches achieve only limited success. Thus, there is a pharmaceutical need to discover new targets and develop novel therapeutics for CRAC therapy. MET and RON receptor tyrosine kinases have been implicated in CRAC pathogenesis. Clinical studies have revealed that aberrant MET and/or RON expression and signaling are critical in regulating CRAC progression and malignant phenotypes. Increased MET and/or RON expression also has prognostic value for CRAC progression and patient survival. These features provide the rationale to target MET and RON for clinical CRAC intervention. At present, the use of small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting MET for CRAC treatment has achieved significant progress with several approvals for clinical application. Nevertheless, antibody-based biotherapeutics, although under clinical trials for more than 8 years, have made very little progress. In this review, we discuss the importance of MET and/or RON in CRAC tumorigenesis and development of anti-MET, anti-RON, and MET and RON-dual targeting antibody-drug conjugates for clinical application. The findings from both preclinical studies and clinical trials highlight the potential of this novel type of biother\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a predominant group of serine/threonine protein kinases involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and its progression, ensuring the integrity and functionality of cellular machinery. These regulatory enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle and transcription, as well as DNA repair, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation, in response to several extracellular and intracellular signals. They are present in all known eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. The catalytic activities of CDKs are regulated by interactions with CDK inhibitors (CKIs) and regulatory subunits known as cyclins. Cyclins have no enzymatic activity themselves, but they become active once they bind to CDKs. Without cyclin, CDK is less active than in the cyclin-CDK heterodimer complex. CDKs phosphorylate proteins on serine (S) or threonine (T) residues. The specificity of CDKs for their substrates is defined by the S/T-P-X-K/R sequence, where S/T is the phosphorylation site, P is proline, X is any amino acid, and the sequence ends with lysine (K) or arginine (R). This motif ensures CDKs accurately target and modify proteins, crucial for regulating cell cycle and other functions. Deregulation of the CDK activity is linked to various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and stroke.\n",

Ataxia refers to poor coordination and telangiectasia to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease. A–T affects many parts of the body:\n",

      "Symptoms most often first appear in early childhood (the toddler stage) when children begin to sit or walk. Though they usually start walking at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still or sitting. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their eyes in a natural manner from one place to the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech, and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A–T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A–T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.\n",

      "Summary::\n",
      "The determination of gamma-seminoprotein (gamma-Sm) (also called prostate-specific antigen [PSA], prostate antigen [PA], or p30) in human serum has been recently demonstrated to be more sensitive and specific for diagnosing prostate cancer and monitoring the condition of patients with prostate cancer than the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) test. Because the gamma-Sm (PSA) test seems likely to replace the PAP test in the area of urology and study of prostate-specific antigens is expanding, we have reviewed physicochemical properties and clinical significance of two prostate-specific antigens, gamma-Sm (PSA) and beta-microseminoprotein (beta-MSP). Both proteins have been proved to originate in the prostate gland and have not been detected in any other human tissues by an immunohistologic study. The usefulness of gamma-Sm and beta-MSP in determining the origin of metastatic tumors has also been shown. gamma-Sm is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 26,079 for the peptide portion, of which the amino acid sequence is identical to so-called PSA and homologous with serine proteases (the kallikrein family). Its chymotrypsin-like activity with a unique substrate specificity has also been demonstrated. The molecular weight of beta-MSP is 10,652 from the amino acid sequence, in which the protein has been shown to contain no alanine residue.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Summary: Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), also called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, are a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafficking, which in turn are involved in cancer.\n",
      "PI3Ks are a family of related intracellular signal transducer enzymes capable of phosphorylating the 3 position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns). The pathway, with oncogene PIK3CA and tumor suppressor gene PTEN, is implicated in the sensitivity of cancer tumors to insulin and IGF1, and in calorie restriction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor\n",
      "Summary: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (PI3K inhibitors) are a class of medical drugs that are mainly used to treat advanced cancers. They function by inhibiting one or more of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes, which are part of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. This signal pathway regulates cellular functions such as growth and survival. It is strictly regulated in healthy cells, but is always active in many cancer cells, allowing the cancer cells to better survive and multiply. PI3K inhibitors block the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and thus slow down cancer growth. They are examples of a targeted therapy. While PI3K inhibitors are an effective treatment, they can have very severe side effects and are therefore only used if other treatments have failed or are not suitable.\n",
      "After PI3K inhibitors had been under investigation as anti-cancer drugs for several years, the first one to be approved for treatment in clinical practice was idelalisib in 2014. Several others followed, and even more are still under development (see below).\n",
      "There are different classes and isoforms of PI3Ks. Class 1 PI3Ks have a catalytic subunit known as p110, with four types (isoforms) – p110 alpha (PIK3CA), p110 beta (PIK3CB), p110 gamma (PIK3CG) and p110 delta (PIK3CD). All PI3K inhibitors that are currently approved inhibit one or more p110 isoforms of the class I PI3Ks. Inhibiting different p110 isoforms can have different effects, e.g. PTEN-negative tumors may be more sensitive to PIK3CB inhibitors.\n",
      "PI3K inhibitors are also under investigation as treatments for inflammatory respiratory disease, and are used to investigate the role of the PI3K pathway in aging.\n",

It is a serine/threonine kinase that acts downstream of PIP3 and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 in the PI3 kinase pathway. As the name suggests, its target substrate is the S6 ribosomal protein.  Phosphorylation of S6 induces protein synthesis at the ribosome.\n",
      "The phosphorylation of p70S6K at threonine 389 has been used as a hallmark of activation by mTOR and correlated with autophagy inhibition in various situations.

Expression of several cell cycle genes in MEG-01 cells was significantly up regulated at early and then down regulated at later stages of A. phagocytophilum infection. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays revealed reduced cellular cytotoxicity in MEG-01 cells upon A. phagocytophilum infection. The levels of both PI3KCA (p110 alpha, catalytic subunit) and PI3KR1 (p85, regulatory subunit) of Class I PI3 kinases and phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) and inhibitory kappa B (IκB) were elevated at both early and late stages of A. phagocytophilum infection. Inhibition of PI3 kinases with LY294002 treatment resulted in significant reduction in the expression of tested cell cycle genes, A. phagocytophilum burden and phosphorylated Akt levels in these MEG-01 cells.

      "PI3K pathway is a very important pathway that is reported to be involved in breast cancer. Mutation of PI3K and p110 alpha-catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA) is of high predictive and prognostic values in breast cancer. The purpose of the current study was to screen the hotspot mutations of the PIK3CA gene i.e. rs2677760, rs3806685, rs121913273 & rs121913279 along with expressional analysis of PI3K and PIK3CA genes in breast cancer female patients. For mutational analysis, TaqMan assay & Sanger sequencing were performed while for expressional analysis real-time PCR was carried out. Mutant allele C of rs2677760 was observed to be high in postmenopausal patients. The frequency of mutant allele G of rs3806685 was significantly high in breast cancer patients. All diseased and control samples were of wild type for the hotspot rs121913273 and rs121913279 with allele G for rs121913273 and A for rs121913279. Expression of the PI3K was high in breast cancer tissue samples as compared to the adjacent controls. While the expression of the thePIK3CA gene was significantly high in premenopausal breast cancer patients. It was concluded that the mutant allele C of rs2677760 might have some sort of association with the menopausal status and it could be used as a diagnostic marker in post-menopausal women if studied further. Mutant allele G of rs3806685 was also found to be associated with breast cancer. While multiallelic rs121913273 and rs121913279 showed a different trend for the studied population.

The pathway communicates information from chemical signals outside of a cell to the cell nucleus, resulting in the activation of genes through the process of transcription. There are three key parts of JAK-STAT signalling: Janus kinases (JAKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins (STATs), and receptors (which bind the chemical signals).

      "Psoriasis is characterized by keratinocyte (KC) hyperproliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In an imiquimod-induced mouse psoriasiform model, p38 activity is significantly elevated in KCs and p38α specific deletion in KCs ameliorates skin inflammation. p38α signaling promotes KC proliferation and psoriasis-related proinflammatory gene expression during psoriasis development. Mechanistically, p38α enhances KC proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by activating STAT3. While p38α signaling in KCs does not affect the expression of IL-23 and IL-17, it substantially amplifies the IL-23/IL-17 pathogenic axis in psoriasis. The therapeutic effect of IL-17 neutralization is associated with decreased p38 and STAT3 activities in KCs and targeting the p38α-STAT3 axis in KCs ameliorates the severity of psoriasis. As IL-17 also highly activates p38 and STAT3 in KCs, our findings reveal a sustained signaling circuit important for psoriasis development, highlighting p38α-STAT3 axis as an important target for psoriasis treatment.\n",

      "Summary: Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is a kinase belonging to the AGC (PKA/ PKG/PKC) family of serine-threonine specific protein kinases. It is involved mainly in regulating the shape and movement of cells by acting on the cytoskeleton.\n",
      "ROCKs (ROCK1 and ROCK2) occur in mammals (human, rat, mouse, cow), zebrafish, Xenopus, invertebrates (C. elegans, mosquito, Drosophila) and chicken. Human ROCK1 has a molecular mass of 158 kDa and is a major downstream effector of the small GTPase RhoA. Mammalian ROCK consists of a kinase domain, a coiled-coil region and a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which reduces the kinase activity of ROCKs by an autoinhibitory intramolecular fold if RhoA-GTP is not present.\n",
      "Rat ROCKs were discovered as the first effectors of Rho and they induce the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions by phosphorylating MLC (myosin light chain).\n",
      "Due to this phosphorylation, the actin binding of myosin II and, thus, the contractility increases. Two mouse ROCK isoforms ROCK1 and ROCK2 have been identified. ROCK1 is mainly expressed in the lung, liver, spleen, kidney and testis. However, ROCK2 is distributed mostly in the brain and heart.\n",
      "Protein kinase C and Rho-associated protein kinase are involved in regulating calcium ion intake; these calcium ions, in turn stimulate a myosin light chain kinase, forcing a contraction. Rho-associated protein kinase are serine or threonine kinases that determine the calcium sensitivity in smooth muscle cells.\n",

      "Summary: Transforming protein RhoA, also known as Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), is a small GTPase protein in the Rho family of GTPases that in humans is encoded by the RHOA gene. While the effects of RhoA activity are  not all well known, it is primarily associated with cytoskeleton regulation, mostly actin stress fibers formation and actomyosin contractility. It acts upon several effectors. Among them,  ROCK1 (Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1) and DIAPH1 (Diaphanous Homologue 1, a.k.a. hDia1, homologue to mDia1 in mouse, diaphanous in Drosophila) are the best described. RhoA, and the other Rho GTPases, are part of a larger family of related proteins known as the Ras superfamily, a family of proteins involved in the regulation and timing of cell division. RhoA is one of the oldest Rho GTPases, with homologues present in the genomes since 1.5 billion years. As a consequence, RhoA is somehow involved in many cellular processes which emerged throughout evolution. RhoA specifically is regarded as a prominent regulatory factor in other functions such as the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, transcription, cell cycle progression and cell transformation.\n",

      "Page: Rho kinase inhibitor\n",
      "Summary: Rho-kinase inhibitors (rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor or ROCK inhibitor) are a series of compounds that target rho kinase (ROCK) and inhibit the ROCK pathway. Clinical trials have found that inhibition of the ROCK pathway contributes to the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy. Furthermore, ROCK inhibitors may have clinical applications for anti-erectile dysfunction, antihypertension, and tumor metastasis inhibition. More recently they have been studied for the treatment of glaucoma and as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke. While statin therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, the interplay between the ROCK pathway and statin therapy to treat and prevent strokes in older adults has not yet been proven.\n",

      "Neurodegeneration disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), have garnered significant attention due to their impact on individuals and society as a whole. Understanding the mechanisms behind these disorders and developing effective therapy strategies is of utmost importance. One potential therapeutic target that has emerged is Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), as its accumulation and activity have been closely linked to memory loss. In this report, we present the findings of a recent discovery involving a new molecule that has the ability to competitively inhibit ROCK2 activity. This molecule was identified through the utilization of a DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening platform. Following selection against ROCK2, an off-DNA compound was synthesized and examined to ascertain its inhibitory properties, selectivity, mechanism of action, and binding mode analysis. From the screening, compound CH-2 has demonstrated an IC value of 28 nM against ROCK2, while exhibiting a 5-fold selectivity over ROCK1. Further analysis through molecular docking has provided insights into the specific binding modes of this compound. Our findings suggest that DEL selection offers a rapid method for identifying new inhibitors. Among these, the CH-2 compound shows promise as a potential ROCK2 inhibitor and warrants further investigation.\n",

      "Response: JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) plays a critical role in signaling pathways related to hematopoiesis and immune response. It is activated by various cytokine receptors, including those for erythropoietin, which is essential for red blood cell production. Upon activation, JAK2 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptor, creating docking sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). This leads to the activation of STATs, which translocate to the nucleus and regulate the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In the context of immune response, JAK2 is crucial for the signaling of several cytokines that influence the development and function of immune cells.

      "BACKGROUND: Blast transformation is a rare but well-recognized event in Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms associated with a poor prognosis. Secondary acute myeloid leukemias evolving from myeloproliferative neoplasms are characterized by a unique set of cytogenetic and molecular features distinct from de novo disease. t(8;21) (q22;q22.1); RUNX1::RUNX1T1, one of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in de novo acute myeloid leukemia, is rarely observed in post-myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia. Here we report a case of secondary acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21) evolving from JAK2-mutated essential thrombocythemia.\n",
      "CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 74-year-old Japanese woman who was referred because of thrombocytosis (platelets 1046 × 10/L). Bone marrow was hypercellular with increase of megakaryocytes. Chromosomal analysis presented normal karyotype and genetic test revealed JAK2 V617F mutation. She was diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis had been well controlled by oral administration of hydroxyurea; 2 years after the initial diagnosis with ET, she presented with leukocytosis (white blood cells 14.0 × 10/L with 82% of blasts), anemia (hemoglobin 91 g/L), and thrombocytopenia (platelets 24 × 10/L). Bone marrow was hypercellular and filled with 80% of myeloperoxidase-positive blasts bearing Auer rods. Chromosomal analysis revealed t(8;21) (q22;q22.1) and flow cytometry presented positivity of CD 13, 19, 34, and 56. Molecular analysis showed the coexistence of RUNX1::RUNX1T1 chimeric transcript and heterozygous JAK2 V617F mutation in leukemic blasts.

It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.\n",
      "Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue, inability to catch one's breath, tightness in the abdominal region, nausea, and problems in concentration. Anxiety is closely related to fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat (fight-or-flight response); anxiety involves the expectation of a future threat including dread. People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.\n",
      "The emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time-periods in response to specific events, and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder). The difference between anxiety disorder (as mental disorder) and anxiety (as normal emotion), is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety excessively or persistently during approximately 6 months, or even during shorter time-periods in children. Anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades.

      "Copyright Information: © 2024. The Author(s).\n",
      "Summary::\n",
      "Synaptic dysfunction is an early pathogenic event leading to cognitive decline in Huntington's disease (HD). We previously reported that the active ADAM10 level is increased in the HD cortex and striatum, causing excessive proteolysis of the synaptic cell adhesion protein N-Cadherin. Conversely, ADAM10 inhibition is neuroprotective and prevents cognitive decline in HD mice. Although the breakdown of cortico-striatal connection has been historically linked to cognitive deterioration in HD, dendritic spine loss and long-term potentiation (LTP) defects identified in the HD hippocampus are also thought to contribute to the cognitive symptoms of the disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of ADAM10 to spine pathology and LTP defects of the HD hippocampus. We provide evidence that active ADAM10 is increased in the hippocampus of two mouse models of HD, leading to extensive proteolysis of N-Cadherin, which has a widely recognized role in spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Importantly, the conditional heterozygous deletion of ADAM10 in the forebrain of HD mice resulted in the recovery of spine loss and ultrastructural synaptic defects in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Meanwhile, normalization of the active ADAM10 level increased the pool of synaptic BDNF protein and activated ERK neuroprotective signaling in the HD hippocampus. We also show that the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X restored LTP defects and increased the density of mushroom spines enriched with GluA1-AMPA receptors in HD hippocampal neurons. Notably, we report that administration of the TrkB antagonist ANA12 to HD hippocampal neurons reduced the beneficial effect of GI254023X, indicating that the BDNF receptor TrkB contributes to mediate the neuroprotective activity exerted by ADAM10 inhibition in HD.

      "Response: The Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor RET is essential for signaling in the GDNF family, crucial for the development of the enteric nervous system and gastrointestinal motility, with mutations linked to Hirschsprung disease and various cancers. The Macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP) receptor, also known as RON, regulates inflammation and immune responses, playing a role in chronic inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and potentially facilitating immune escape in tumors. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a key regulator of the cell cycle and transcription, implicated in various cancers and emerging as a promising therapeutic target. Serine-protein kinase ATM, or Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated, is vital for responding to DNA damage, maintaining genomic stability, and is associated with Ataxia-telangiectasia, a disorder that increases cancer risk. Plasma kallikrein is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the kinin-kallikrein system, regulating blood pressure, inflammation, and pain. The p110-alpha subunit of PI3-kinase, encoded by the PIK3CA gene, is significantly involved in various diseases, especially breast cancer, where mutations are associated with poor prognosis and treatment response. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, regulating immunity and cell survival, with dysregulation linked to cancers and immune disorders. Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (ROCK2) regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and is implicated in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, Tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 is crucial for hematopoiesis and immune response, with mutations associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms, making it a significant therapeutic target. Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) is essential for neuronal survival and function, with dysregulation linked to neurological disorders.\n",
