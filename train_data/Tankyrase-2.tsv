Compound activity in inhibiting the TNKS and PARP autoparsylation was evaluated by IC50 measurements. In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in 8-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 uM of p-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of p-NAD+. The % Inhibition was calculated as: (Control-Sample)/(Control-Background)*100. 'Control' is the average value of 8 wells without compound; and 'Background' is the average of 8 wells mixed with 5x quenching solution measured prior to initiation of the reaction."

In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in 8-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 uM of p-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of p-NAD+. The % Inhibition was calculated as: (Control-Sample)/(Control-Background)*100.

In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in beta-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 nM of beta-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d4]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of beta-NAD+."

In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in 8-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 uM of p-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of p-NAD+. The % Inhibition was calculated as: (Control-Sample)/(Control-Background)*100.

In the compound screening assays, the reaction is composed of 5 uL of compound in 8-point serial dilutions with concentrations ranging from 0.0086 to 18.75 uM, 20 nM of purified enzyme, and 250 uM of p-NAD+ in the 1x Assay Buffer. After 60 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of 10 uL of 5x quenching solution (20% formic acid and 500 nM [d]-nicotinamide in water). For the background control wells, 10 uL of the 5x quenching solution per well was added prior to the addition of p-NAD+. The % Inhibition was calculated as: (Control-Sample)/(Control-Background)*100.
