Each assay plate contained 8-point serial dilutions for 40 test compounds, as well as four 8-point serial dilutions of staurosporine as a reference compound, plus 16 high and 16 low controls. Liquid handling and incubation steps were done on a Thermo CatX workstation equipped with Innovadyne Nanodrop Express. Between pipetting steps, tips were cleaned in wash cycles using wash buffer. The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nL per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 μL per well of peptide/ATP-solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 4 μM ATP, 4 μM peptide (FITC-Ahx-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2)) and 4.5 μL per well of enzyme solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 3.5 nM ABL (ABL(64-515), produced in-house from E. coli)). Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 μL per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Each assay plate contained 8-point serial dilutions for 40 test compounds, as well as four 8-point serial dilutions of staurosporine as a reference compound, plus 16 high and 16 low controls. Liquid handling and incubation steps were done on a Thermo CatX workstation equipped with Innovadyne Nanodrop Express. Between pipetting steps, tips were cleaned in wash cycles using wash buffer. The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nL per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 μL per well of peptide/ATP-solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 4 μM ATP, 4 μM peptide (FITC-Ahx-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2)) and 4.5 μL per well of enzyme solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 3.5 nM ABL (ABL(64-515), produced in-house from E. coli)). Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 μL per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Kinase buffer: 62.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.001875% Brij-35; 12.5 mM MgCl2; 2.5 mM DTT. Stop buffer: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.015% Brij-35; 0.2% coating agent 3; 50 mM EDTA. Preparation of kinase solution: Kinase solution was obtained by dissolving kinases in the kinase buffer mentioned above. With regard to c-Kit kinase, the pre-activation treatments should be carried out as follows. 700 nM c-Kit, 2 mM ATP, 4 mM DTT and 10 mM MgCl2 were dissolved in kinase buffer.

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Pre-incubation of enzyme with compounds (when stated) was performed by exposing the enzyme to compounds prior to addition of the substrate mixture (ATP and/or peptide substrate). After 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL 125 mM EDTA, and the peptide-bound 33P separated on filter-plates (PVDF or MAIP; Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland) prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Filter-plates were washed 3× with 0.5% H3PO4, followed by addition of 30 μL scintillation cocktail (Microscint, Perkin Elmer) per well and then analysed in a TopCount NXT scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer)."

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Each assay plate contained 8-point serial dilutions for 40 test compounds, as well as four 8-point serial dilutions of staurosporine as a reference compound, plus 16 high and 16 low controls. Liquid handling and incubation steps were done on a Thermo CatX workstation equipped with Innovadyne Nanodrop Express. Between pipetting steps, tips were cleaned in wash cycles using wash buffer. The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nL per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 μL per well of peptide/ATP-solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 4 μM ATP, 4 μM peptide (FITC-Ahx-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2)) and 4.5 μL per well of enzyme solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 3.5 nM ABL (ABL(64-515), produced in-house from E. coli)).

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Liquid handling and incubation steps were done on a Thermo CatX workstation equipped with Innovadyne Nanodrop Express. Between pipetting steps, tips were cleaned in wash cycles using wash buffer. The assay plates were prepared by addition of 50 nL per well of compound solution in 90% DMSO. The kinase reactions were started by stepwise addition of 4.5 μL per well of peptide/ATP-solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 4 μM ATP, 4 μM peptide (FITC-Ahx-EAIYAAPFAKKK-NH2)) and 4.5 μL per well of enzyme solution (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% BSA, 0.6% DMSO, 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM sodium orthovanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 3.5 nM ABL (ABL(64-515), produced in-house from E. coli)). Kinase reactions were incubated at 30 °C. for 60 minutes and subsequently terminated by addition of 16 μL per well of stop solution (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% DMSO, 0.1% Caliper coating reagent, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.015% Brij35). Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Plates with terminated kinase reactions were transferred to the Caliper LC3000 workstations for reading. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were separated using the Caliper microfluidic mobility shift technology. Briefly, samples from terminated kinase reactions were applied to the chip. Analytes are transported through the chip by constant buffer flow and the migration of the substrate peptide is monitored by the fluorescence signal of its label. Phosphorylated peptide (product) and unphosphorylated peptide (substrate) are separated in an electric field by their charge/mass ratio."

Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction."
