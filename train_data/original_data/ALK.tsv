EML4-ALK fusion protein v1 was investigated for its phosphorylation activity toward a peptide substrate by using a kinase activity detection kit (HTRF KinEASE-TK; Cisbio Inc.). Test compounds were each added to a reaction solution containing the enzyme protein to give 8 final concentrations from 1000 nM to 0.3 nM, followed by addition of ATP."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4.

The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays.

E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 C. until lysis (90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand."

E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 C. until lysis (90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand."

Using a magnetic bead reagent for cell separation and a purification column (anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody immobilized on magnetic beads and a MiniMACS purification column; both are products of MilteDyi Biotec Inc.), cell surface CD8-expressing cells were purified to establish EML4-ALK fusion protein v1-expressing BA/F3 cells. From the cells, EML4-ALK fusion protein v1 was purified and subjected to kinase activity evaluation. EML4-ALK fusion protein v1 was investigated for its phosphorylation activity toward a peptide substrate by using a kinase activity detection kit (HTRF KinEASE-TK; Cisbio Inc.).

E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 C. until lysis (90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above.

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above.

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."

E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 C. until lysis (90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand."

E. coli were grown to log-phase and infected with T7 phage from a frozen stock (multiplicity of infection 0.1) and incubated with shaking at 32 C. until lysis (90 minutes). The lysates were centrifuged (6,000xg) and filtered (0.2 mm) to remove cell debris. The remaining kinases were produced in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for qPCR detection. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated small molecule ligands for 30 minutes at room temperature to generate affinity resins for kinase assays. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand."

Recombinant 3C protease was used to remove the GST tag. Purified ALK was used to screen inhibitors in the ELISA-based kinase assay, as follows: Nunc-Immuno 96-well plates were incubated overnight at 30° C. with coating solution containing 2 μg of a specific ALK peptide substrate (ARDIYRASFFRKGGCAMLPVK) in PBS. Wells were then washed with 200 μL of wash buffer (PBS-Tween 0.05%) and incubated with 4% BSA in PBS for at least 2 h at 30° C. The kinase reaction was performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM ATP and purified rALK in a total volume of 100 μL/well at 30° C. for 15 min. For inhibitor testing the reaction mix was preincubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 10 min at room temperature before transferring to the ELISA plate. After the reaction, the wells were washed 5 times with 200 μL of wash buffer. Phosphorylated peptide was detected using 100 μL/well of a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10 UpstateBiotech Ltd) diluted 1:2000 in PBS+4% BSA. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the antibody was removed and wells were washed as described above. 100 μL of a secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Horseradish Peroxidase linked whole antibody, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000 in PBS+4% BSA was added to each well and the plate was incubated again for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above. The plate was developed using 100 μL/well TMB Substrate Solution (Pierce) and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 1M H2SO4. Finally, the absorbance was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad)."
