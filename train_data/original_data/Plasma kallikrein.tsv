For the assays, 250 nL of the 90% (v/v) DMSO/water solution or compound solution were added per well, followed by the addition of 12.5 ul protease solution (protease in assay buffer). The final assay concentration of the human plasma kallikrein was nominally 25 pM, the 11 compound concentrations in the dilution series were in the range form 1 nM to 100 uM. After 1 hour of pre-incubation at room temperature, the reactions were started by the addition of 12.5 ul substrate solution (in assay buffer, final assay concentration was 0.5 uM). After the addition of the substrate solution, the final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.9% (v/v)."
