Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK1, 150 minutes for JAK2, 90 minutes for JAK3 and 70 minutes for Tyk2."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

The assay principle involves detection of a phosphorylated substrate using energy transfer from a phosphospecific europium-labeled antibody to streptavidin-allophycocyanin as an acceptor.To test the ability of candidate molecules to inhibit SYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity, molecules are reconstituted in 30% DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 with the final dilution containing DMSO in the absence of the candidate molecule.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

No. PV3192, diluted with 1.33× Kinase Buffer), 2.5 μL ATP Solution (300/100/40/100M, JAK1/JAK2/JAK3/TYK2) or 1.33× Kinase Buffer (Invitrogen, Cat. No. PV3189, 5× diluted with distilled water). The 384-well assay plate (Corning, Cat. No. 3575) is mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. 5 μL of the Development Solution (Dilute Development Reagent A (Cat. No. PV3297) is diluted to 1/64 with Development Buffer (Cat. No. PV3127) for JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 assay; Development Reagent A (Cat. No. PV3297) is diluted to 1/2048 with Development Buffer (Cat. No. PV3127) for TYK2 assay. The diluted Development Solution is then added to each well, mixed and incubated at room temperature for another 1 hour. The kinase reaction is then stopped by adding 5 μL of the Stop Reagent (Invitrogen, Cat. No. PV3094), and the plate is read with Wallac 1420 VICTOR3 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer™) at 445 nm and 520 nm fluorescence. All compounds are initially tested at 8 different concentrations (1 μM down to 0.0003 μM) using a 1:3 serial dilution scheme."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK1, 150 minutes for JAK2, 90 minutes for JAK3 and 70 minutes for Tyk2."

Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK1, 150 minutes for JAK2, 90 minutes for JAK3 and 70 minutes for Tyk2."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

The catalytic activity of JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide. The phosphorylated peptide was detected by homogenous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF). IC50s of compounds were measured for each kinase in the reactions that contain the enzyme, ATP and 500 nM peptide in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.8) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL (0.01%) BSA.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

Termination solution: 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.0015% Brij-35, 0.2% Coating Reagent#3, 50 mM EDTA. 2.5-fold kinase solution: The kinase was added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold kinase solution. 2.5-fold substrate solution: FAM fluorescence-labelled polypeptide and ATP were added to the 1-fold kinase buffer to form a 2.5-fold substrate solution. Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

Reactions were carried out in a 384-well plate (Matrical MP-101) in a 10 L total volume. Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

Reaction mixtures contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.0005% Tween-20, ATP (4 M for JAK2 and JAK3, 40 M for JAK1 and 7 M for Tyk2)), 2% DMSO and 1 M peptide substrate (JAKtide for JAK2 and JAK3 and IRS-1 peptide for JAK1 and Tyk2). Compounds were diluted serially in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and tested in an 11 point dose response in duplicate or quadruplicate (200 nl of compound/DMSO was added per 10 L reaction). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the final concentration of 2 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3, 12 nM Tyk2 or 20 nM JAK1. The assay was run for 240 minutes for JAK1, 150 minutes for JAK2, 90 minutes for JAK3 and 70 minutes for Tyk2."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 3 hours and terminated by adding 60 μl of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. Each reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison with no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition, and vehicle-only treated reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay was: ATP, 8 μM; fluoresceinated peptide, 1.5 μM; GST-JAK3, 4.5 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%."

Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate. After equilibration, 2 \xL of 10X ATP in IX assay buffer was added to initiate the kinase reaction and the plates were shaken."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.

The assays were initiated by the addition of 20 nM JAK1, 1 nM JAK2, 1 nM JAK3 or 1 nM TYK2 enzyme and were incubated at room temperature for three hours for JAK1, 60 minutes for JAK2, 75 minutes for JAK3 or 135 minutes for TYK2. Enzyme concentrations and incubation times were optimized for each new enzyme preps and were modified slightly over time to ensure 20%-30% phosphorylation. The assays were stopped with a final concentration of 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Coating Reagent and 100 mM HEPES, pH=7.4."

The reactions employed a common peptide substrate, LCB-EQEDEPEGDYFEWLW-NH2 (in-house). The basic assay protocol is as follows: First, 250 nL of diluted compounds in DMSO were dispensed into the wells of a dry 384- well Black plate (Greiner #781076) using a Labcyte Echo 555 acoustic dispenser.Subsequent reagent additions employed an Agilent Bravo. Next, 18 of 1.1 IX enzyme and 1.1 IX substrate in IX assay buffer (Invitrogen kinase buffer # PV3189, 2 mM DTT, 0.05% BSA) were added to the wells and shaken and then preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to allow compound binding to equilibrate.
