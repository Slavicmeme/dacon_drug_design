AKT1 activation was achieved by the addition of the activating kinases PDK1 and MAPKAPK2, lipid vesicles, and ATP. The extent of peptide phosphorylation was determined using a phospho-AKT substrate antibody and acceptor beads conjugated to Protein A and donor beads conjugated to streptavidin that bind to the biotin on the peptide. Excitation of the donor beads converted ambient oxygen to excited singlet oxygen which, when in close proximity to acceptor beads, reacted with acceptor beads resulting in signal amplification."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5).

Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition).

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."

The prepared AKT1 and AKT2 were stored at Ã¢ 80C. until the time of measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds. In the measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds, AKT1 or AKT2 and each compound of the present invention were preincubated at 25C. for 120 minutes in a buffer solution for reaction (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT). As a substrate, biotinylated Crosstide (bioton-KGSGSGRPRTSSFAEG), MgCl2, and ATP were added to final concentrations."

In the preparation of AKT1 and AKT2, human AKT1 and AKT2 to which a middle T antigen tag was added were expressed in Sf 9 insect cells, and then AKT1 and AKT2 were prepared following affinity purification and activation by PDK1. The prepared AKT1 and AKT2 were stored at Ã¢ 80C. until the time of measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds. In the measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds, AKT1 or AKT2 and each compound of the present invention were preincubated at 25C. for 120 minutes in a buffer solution for reaction (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT).

The prepared AKT1 and AKT2 were stored at Ã¢ 80C. until the time of measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds. In the measurement of inhibitory activity of the compounds, AKT1 or AKT2 and each compound of the present invention were preincubated at 25C. for 120 minutes in a buffer solution for reaction (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT). As a substrate, biotinylated Crosstide (bioton-KGSGSGRPRTSSFAEG), MgCl2, and ATP were added to final concentrations."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."

As substrate for the kinase reaction the biotinylated peptide biotin-Ahx-KKLNRTLSFAEPG (C-terminus in amide form) was used which can be purchased e.g. from the company Biosynthan GmbH (Berlin-Buch, Germany). For the assay 50 nl of a 100 fold concentrated solution of the test compound in DMSO was pipetted into a black low volume 384 well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany), 2 μl of a solution of Akt1 in assay buffer [50 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma)] were added and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. to allow prebinding of the test compounds to the enzyme before the start of the kinase reaction. Then the kinase reaction was started by the addition of 3 μl of a solution of adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP, 16.7 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 10 μM) and substrate (1.67 μM=>final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume is 1 μM) in assay buffer and the resulting mixture was incubated for a reaction time of 60 min at 22 °C. The concentration of Akt1 in the assay was adjusted depending of the activity of the enzyme lot and was chosen appropriate to have the assay in the linear range, typical enzyme concentrations were in the range of about 0.05 ng/μl (final conc. in the 5 μl assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a solution of HTRF detection reagents (200 nM streptavidine-XL665 [Cisbio] and 1.5 nM anti-phosho-Serine antibody [Millipore, cat. #35-001] and 0.75 nM LANCE Eu-W 1024 labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody [Perkin Elmer]) in an aqueous EDTA-solution (100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5). The resulting mixture was incubated 1 h at 22 °C. to allow the binding of the biotinylated phosphorylated peptide to the streptavidine-XL665 and the antibodies. Subsequently the amount of phosphorylated substrate was evaluated by measurement of the resonance energy transfer from the anti-mouse-IgG-Eu-Chelate to the streptavidine-XL665. Therefore, the fluorescence emissions at 620 nm and 665 nm after excitation at 350 nm was measured in a HTRF reader, e.g. a Rubystar (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) or a Viewlux (Perkin-Elmer). The ratio of the emissions at 665 nm and at 622 nm was taken as the measure for the amount of phosphorylated substrate. The data were normalised (enzyme reaction without inhibitor=0% inhibition, all other assay components but no enzyme=100% inhibition). Normally test compound were tested on the same microtiter plate at 10 different concentrations in the range of 20 μM to 1 nM (20 μM, 6.7 μM, 2.2 μM, 0.74 μM, 0.25 μM, 82 nM, 27 nM, 9.2 nM, 3.1 nM and 1 nM, dilution series prepared before the assay at the level of the 100 fold conc. stock solutions by serial 1:3 dilutions) in duplicate values for each concentration and IC50 values were calculated by a 4 parameter fit using an in-house software."
