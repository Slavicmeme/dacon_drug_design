Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm.

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm.

The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat.

Compounds: The final test concentration of the compound was 10 μM at maximum. Firstly, a 50-fold concentration (i.e. 500 μM) was prepared with 100% DMSO. The compound was diluted with 100% DMSO by 5 folds at 5 concentrations (successively 500 μM, 100 μM, 20 μM, 4 μM, and 0.8 μM). After diluting with 1-fold kinase buffer by 10 folds, 5 μl of the samples were transferred to a 384-well reaction plate. Two negative control wells and two positive control wells were set at each line respectively. Replication was made in a 96-well plate in five concentrations of 5-fold compound. 10% DMSO was added to the positive control well, and 5 μl of EDTA (250 mM) was added to the negative control well. Procedure: To the 384-well reaction plate was added 5-fold compound dissolved in 10% DMSO at 5 μl/well. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold kinase solution at 10 Î¼l/well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10 mins. To the 384-well reaction plate was added 2.5-fold substrate solution at 10 μl/well. The plate was incubated at 28° C. for a certain period. 25 μl termination solution was added to terminate the reaction."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were dissolved in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO was <2%, and the reaction was initiated with Rho kinase variants. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides separated using a LABCHIP® 3000 Reader (Caliper Life Sciences). Controls consisted of assays that did not contain compound, and backgrounds consisted of assays that contained enzyme and substrate but had EDTA from the beginning of the reaction to inhibit kinase activity."

After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides separated using a LABCHIP® 3000 Reader (Caliper Life Sciences).

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds.

Test compounds, dissolved in neat DMSO at 500 μg/mL, are serially diluted for dose response for a final starting concentration of 3 μg/mL in 1% DMSO of assay buffer. ROCKII (1-543) (62,408 Da) is diluted in assay buffer to a final concentration of 7.5 nM in a total volume of 15 μL."

Compounds were dissolved in DMSO so that the final concentration of DMSO was <2%, and the reaction was initiated with Rho kinase variants. After incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA and the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides separated using a LabChip 3000 Reader (Caliper Life Sciences). Controls consisted of assays that did not contain compound, and backgrounds consisted of assays that contained enzyme and substrate but had EDTA from the beginning of the reaction to inhibit kinase activity.

Compounds were tested on three separate days with 8 point dilutions done in duplicate to determine the average IC50 values. The assay conditions were optimized to 15 μl of kinase reaction volume with 5 ng of enzyme in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.01% Brij-35. The reaction was incubated 1 hr. at room temperature in the presence of 1.5 μM of substrate with 12.5 μM of ATP (ROCK1 assay) or 2 μM of substrate with 50 μM of ATP (ROCK2 assay) in the presence of various concentrations of the compounds. The reaction was then stopped and the ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated peptide substrate was determined by selective cleavage of only the unphosphorylated peptide as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, cat. PV3793). This was followed by excitation of coumarin at 400 nm resulting in emission at 445 nm and energy transfer to fluorescein and final emission at 520 nm. The substrate contains both coumarin and fluorescein and only uncleaved phosphorylated substrate will undergo FRET."
