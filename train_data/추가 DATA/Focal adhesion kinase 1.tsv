The kinase activity is detected by means of the phosphorylation of the substrate in a DELFIA assay. The phosphorylated substrate is detected with the Europium-labelled phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Perkin Elmer, No.: AD0038). In order to determine concentration-activity curves with PTK2-inhibitors the compounds are serially diluted in 10% DMSO/H2O and 10 L of each dilution are dispensed per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (clear U-shaped base plate, Greiner No. 650101) (the inhibitors are tested in duplicates) and mixed with 10 L/well of PTK2 kinase (0.01 ug/well). PTK2 kinase is diluted accordingly beforehand with kinase dilution buffer (20 mM TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.286 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol with the addition of freshly prepared BSA (fraction V 1 mg/mL) and DTT (1 mM))."

The kinase solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20) was adjusted to a final concentration of 3 nM by adding FAK diluted to 6 nM (2×) in white 384 OptiPlate, and added with an amount of 5 μL. 4× ULight-poly GT was adjusted to a final concentration of 100 nM. ATP (Sigma #A2383) was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 μM and in 2.5 μL aliquots. The test compound was sequentially diluted at 12 concentrations and treated with an amount of 0.5 μL. After shaking well and allowing to react at room temperature for 60 minutes, 5 μL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, final concentration 40 mM) diluted in Lance detection buffer (Lance detection buffer) was added and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 minutes to stop the reaction. After adding 4× Eu-anti-phospho-Tyr (PT66) phosphorylated antibody diluted to a final concentration of 2 nM in detection buffer with an amount of 5 μL, and reaction was performed at room temperature for 60 minutes.

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock.

After shaking well and allowing to react at room temperature for 60 minutes, 5 μL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, final concentration 40 mM) diluted in Lance detection buffer (Lance detection buffer) was added and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 minutes to stop the reaction. After adding 4× Eu-anti-phospho-Tyr (PT66) phosphorylated antibody diluted to a final concentration of 2 nM in detection buffer with an amount of 5 μL, and reaction was performed at room temperature for 60 minutes. After adjusting to detect time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) at excitation wavelength 320 nm and emission wavelength 665 nm, signals were detected using EnVision Multilabel Reader."

ATP (Sigma #A2383) was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 μM and in 2.5 μL aliquots. The test compound was sequentially diluted at 12 concentrations and treated with an amount of 0.5 μL. After shaking well and allowing to react at room temperature for 60 minutes, 5 μL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, final concentration 40 mM) diluted in Lance detection buffer (Lance detection buffer) was added and the mixture was left at room temperature for 5 minutes to stop the reaction.

A 5 μl of 100× stock of each concentration was added to wells containing 95 μl of 1× reaction buffer (40 mM Tris, pH7.5, mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM CHAPS) to generate 5× stock.
