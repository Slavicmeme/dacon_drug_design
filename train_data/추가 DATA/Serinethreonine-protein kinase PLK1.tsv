Fragment ligated inhibitors and comparison peptides to be tested in the binding assay were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 10 mM, compounds were utilized in a range of concentrations from 10 nM to 600 μM. The PLK1 PBD protein (residues 367-603) was obtained from BPS Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) and 250 ng was used per sample. The fluorescein-tracer phospho-peptide was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Each sample was prepared in triplicate in a black 96-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). Reactants were added to the plate in darkened conditions to minimize exposure to light. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes. Fluorescence was measured using a DTX 880 Multimode detector plate reader (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.) and Multimode Analysis software (Beckman Coulter)."

The PLK1 PBD protein (residues 367-603) was obtained from BPS Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) and 250 ng was used per sample. The fluorescein-tracer phospho-peptide was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Each sample was prepared in triplicate in a black 96-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). Reactants were added to the plate in darkened conditions to minimize exposure to light. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes. Fluorescence was measured using a DTX 880 Multimode detector plate reader (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.) and Multimode Analysis software (Beckman Coulter)."

Compounds were tested in 5 dose IC50 mode with 10-fold serial dilution starting at 10 μM. Staurosporine, a known protein kinase inhibitor, was tested in 5-dose IC50 mode with 3-fold serial dilution starting at 20 μM. Reactions were carried out in 10 μM ATP.

The fluorescein-tracer phospho-peptide was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Each sample was prepared in triplicate in a black 96-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). Reactants were added to the plate in darkened conditions to minimize exposure to light. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes.

The PLK1 PBD protein (residues 367-603) was obtained from BPS Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) and 250 ng was used per sample. The fluorescein-tracer phospho-peptide was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Each sample was prepared in triplicate in a black 96-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). Reactants were added to the plate in darkened conditions to minimize exposure to light. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes.

Fragment ligated inhibitors and comparison peptides to be tested in the binding assay were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 10 mM, compounds were utilized in a range of concentrations from 10 nM to 600 μM. The PLK1 PBD protein (residues 367-603) was obtained from BPS Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, Calif.) and 250 ng was used per sample. The fluorescein-tracer phospho-peptide was used at a final concentration of 100 nM. Each sample was prepared in triplicate in a black 96-well plate (Greiner, Monroe, N.C.). Reactants were added to the plate in darkened conditions to minimize exposure to light. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 minutes.
