To prepare the enzyme buffer, 30 mL (10 units) of pig pancreatic lipase solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.8) were mixed with 10 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulphonic acid), which was added to 850 mL of tris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0). Then, 100 mL of the rotenoisin A or B of the present invention was mixed with the prepared enzyme buffer at the experimental concentration. As the positive control, 880 mL of Orlistat (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was mixed with the enzyme buffer. 20 mL of substrate solution containing 20 mM p-nitrophenylbutyrate dissolved in dimethyl formaide was added to the enzyme buffer, followed by culture for 15 minutes at 37° C. that was the temperature adequate for enzyme reaction."

To prepare the enzyme buffer, 30 mL (10 units) of pig pancreatic lipase solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.8) were mixed with 10 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulphonic acid), which was added to 850 mL of tris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0). Then, 100 mL of the rotenoisin A or B of the present invention was mixed with the prepared enzyme buffer at the experimental concentration. As the positive control, 880 mL of Orlistat (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was mixed with the enzyme buffer. 20 mL of substrate solution containing 20 mM p-nitrophenylbutyrate dissolved in dimethyl formaide was added to the enzyme buffer, followed by culture for 15 minutes at 37° C. that was the temperature adequate for enzyme reaction."

To prepare the enzyme buffer, 30 mL (10 units) of pig pancreatic lipase solution (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.8) were mixed with 10 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulphonic acid), which was added to 850 mL of tris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.0). Then, 100 mL of the rotenoisin A or B of the present invention was mixed with the prepared enzyme buffer at the experimental concentration. As the positive control, 880 mL of Orlistat (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was mixed with the enzyme buffer. 20 mL of substrate solution containing 20 mM p-nitrophenylbutyrate dissolved in dimethyl formaide was added to the enzyme buffer, followed by culture for 15 minutes at 37° C. that was the temperature adequate for enzyme reaction."
