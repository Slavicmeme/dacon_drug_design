The solutions of the compounds according to the invention at these various concentrations are prepared by diluting in a test buffer (Tris 50 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 M, DTT 2 mM and EGTA 1 mM) a stock solution in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The 'U'-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50).

After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner. The radiation emitted by each well is then measured for 2 minutes in a TopCount NXT Packard scintillation counter, in which the values of CPM/well are measured."

The solutions of the compounds according to the invention at these various concentrations are prepared by diluting in a test buffer (Tris 50 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 M, DTT 2 mM and EGTA 1 mM) a stock solution in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The 'U'-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner. The radiation emitted by each well is then measured for 2 minutes in a TopCount NXT Packard scintillation counter, in which the values of CPM/well are measured."

The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner. The radiation emitted by each well is then measured for 2 minutes in a TopCount NXT Packard scintillation counter, in which the values of CPM/well are measured."

The solutions of the compounds according to the invention at these various concentrations are prepared by diluting in a test buffer (Tris 50 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 M, DTT 2 mM and EGTA 1 mM) a stock solution in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The 'U'-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA.

The solutions of the compounds according to the invention at these various concentrations are prepared by diluting in a test buffer (Tris 50 mM pH 7.5, MgCl2 10 M, DTT 2 mM and EGTA 1 mM) a stock solution in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The 'U'-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner.

The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIPÂ®3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the unphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison of the no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assay were 200 pM CK1ε or CK1δ, 50 uM ATP, 1.5 uM FL-AHA-KRRRAL-PSER-VASLPGL-OH, and 1.6% DMSO. Dose response curves were generated to determine the concentration required to inhibit 50% of the kinase activity (IC50). Compounds were dissolved at 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and evaluated at eleven concentrations. IC50 values were derived by non-linear regression analysis."

Next, 5 uL of dephosphorylated casein are added to a final concentration of 0.2 ug/uL, 20 uL of CK1 epsilon to a final concentration of 3 ng/uL, and 20 uL of ATP-33P to a final concentration of 0.02 uCi/uL mixed with cold ATP (10 uM final approximately 2x106 CPM per well). The final total test volume per well is equal to 50 uL. The 'U'-bottomed Falcon test plate mentioned above is vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. After 2 hours the reaction is stopped by adding an ice-cold solution of 65 uL of cold ATP (2 mM) prepared in test buffer. 100 uL of the reaction mixture are then transferred from the 'U'-bottomed Falcon plate into Millipore MAPH filter plates, preimpregnated with 25 uL of ice-cold 100% TCA. The Millipore MAPH filter plates are agitated gently and are left to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes to precipitate the proteins. After 30 minutes, the filter plates are sequentially washed and filtered with 2x150 uL of 20% TCA, 2x150 uL of 10% TCA and 2x150 uL of 5% TCA (6 washes in total per plate/900 uL per well). The plates are left to dry overnight at room temperature. Next, 40 uL of Microscint-20 Packard scintillation liquid are added per well and the plates are closed in a leaktight manner. The radiation emitted by each well is then measured for 2 minutes in a TopCount NXT Packard scintillation counter, in which the values of CPM/well are measured."
