The following morning compounds of Formula (I) in 100% DMSO were added to assay plates by acoustic dispensing. After 1 h incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO2 plates (up to 6 at a time) were irradiated using the X-RAD 320 instrument (PXi) with equivalent to Ë¿600 cGy. Plates were returned to the incubator for a further 1 h. Then cells were fixed by adding 20 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS solution and incubating for 20 minutes at r.t. before being washed with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Then 20 μ 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS was added and incubated for 20 minutes at r.t., to permeabalise cells. Then the plates were washed once with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Phospho-ATM Ser1981 antibody (Millipore #MAB3806) was diluted 10000 fold in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA and 20 μl was added to each well and incubated over night at r.t. The next morning plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and then 20 μl of secondary Ab solution, containing 500 fold diluted Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, A11001) and 0.002 mg/ml Hoeschst dye (Life technologies #H-3570), in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA, was added. After 1 h incubation at r.t., the plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and plates were sealed and kept in PBS at 4° C. until read. Plates were read using an ArrayScan VTI instrument, using an XF53 filter with 10× objective. A two laser set up was used to analyse nuclear staining with Hoeschst (405 nm) and secondary antibody staining of pSer1981 (488 nm)."

The following morning compounds of Formula (I) in 100% DMSO were added to assay plates by acoustic dispensing. After 1 h incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO2 plates (up to 6 at a time) were irradiated using the X-RAD 320 instrument (PXi) with equivalent to Ë¿600 cGy. Plates were returned to the incubator for a further 1 h. Then cells were fixed by adding 20 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS solution and incubating for 20 minutes at r.t. before being washed with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Then 20 μ 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS was added and incubated for 20 minutes at r.t., to permeabalise cells. Then the plates were washed once with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Phospho-ATM Ser1981 antibody (Millipore #MAB3806) was diluted 10000 fold in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA and 20 μl was added to each well and incubated over night at r.t. The next morning plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and then 20 μl of secondary Ab solution, containing 500 fold diluted Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, A11001) and 0.002 mg/ml Hoeschst dye (Life technologies #H-3570), in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA, was added. After 1 h incubation at r.t., the plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and plates were sealed and kept in PBS at 4° C. until read. Plates were read using an ArrayScan VTI instrument, using an XF53 filter with 10× objective. A two laser set up was used to analyse nuclear staining with Hoeschst (405 nm) and secondary antibody staining of pSer1981 (488 nm)."

The following morning compounds of Formula (I) in 100% DMSO were added to assay plates by acoustic dispensing. After 1 h incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO2 plates (up to 6 at a time) were irradiated using the X-RAD 320 instrument (PXi) with equivalent to Ë¿600 cGy. Plates were returned to the incubator for a further 1 h. Then cells were fixed by adding 20 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS solution and incubating for 20 minutes at r.t. before being washed with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Then 20 μ 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS was added and incubated for 20 minutes at r.t., to permeabalise cells. Then the plates were washed once with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Phospho-ATM Ser1981 antibody (Millipore #MAB3806) was diluted 10000 fold in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA and 20 μl was added to each well and incubated over night at r.t.

Then 20 μ 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS was added and incubated for 20 minutes at r.t., to permeabalise cells. Then the plates were washed once with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. Phospho-ATM Ser1981 antibody (Millipore #MAB3806) was diluted 10000 fold in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA and 20 μl was added to each well and incubated over night at r.t. The next morning plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and then 20 μl of secondary Ab solution, containing 500 fold diluted Alexa Fluor® 488 Goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, A11001) and 0.002 mg/ml Hoeschst dye (Life technologies #H-3570), in PBS containing 0.05% polysorbate/Tween and 3% BSA, was added. After 1 h incubation at r.t., the plates were washed three times with 50 μl/well PBS, using a Biotek EL405 plate washer, and plates were sealed and kept in PBS at 4° C. until read. Plates were read using an ArrayScan VTI instrument, using an XF53 filter with 10× objective. A two laser set up was used to analyse nuclear staining with Hoeschst (405 nm) and secondary antibody staining of pSer1981 (488 nm)."
